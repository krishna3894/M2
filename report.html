    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p><b>The mission for this website is to design a user friendly website and invite most of the people in to the music community. As most of the youth are now not interested in the music.So to attract them towards the music there are many events in the centre, We have created the volunteer's page and the events to specially attract the young people. Most of the website is designed to understand about the music community and where one can learn a lot about the music.Even the sposors are encouraging the new people to join the community. Due to this the increase of the tickets will produce some revenue and even the local businesses will be benefitted in and around the community.Due to this many new jobs are also created with which the overall development can be seen through this. The main aim is to involve youth into the music.</b></p>
